# VideoWatcher
## Watch home videos easily: a Unity 2019 open-source project

VideoWatcher is a desktop (Mac and PC) app that will randomly play video files from any specified folder.  Intended as a way to enjoy large libraries of home videos. Users with 1000+ videos will never likely play them all through.  This app will let users enjoy their videos, several at a time.  By clicking on any video, it jumps to another, randomly-selected video.   

Like being a TV producer for your own life.

Next steps:
* Allow "favoriting" of videos: build a favorites playlist
* Enable annotation of videos: title, date created, notes, etc.
* For longer videos (> 30 secs), start at a random point in the video (rather than always play from the beginning)
* Enable iOS/Android version: have to stream video files from a server (since won't likely fit onto the device itself)
